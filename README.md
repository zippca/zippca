- 👋 Hi, I’m Zipperer in north Central Florida.
- 👀 I’m a retired electrical engineer (drives and controls) interested in just about everything.
- 🌱 Used IBM 360 and PDP-8 in college (started out as a physics major), played with home built TI9900 system (still like that design and Assembly Lang) and Radio Shack's modle 2  at home, DOS, Windows, and  a couple  of propriatary programming languages and schemes at work but now concentrate on Linux and Android platforms. I’m currently learning python and possibly to get to know Rust (got tired of Fortran & BASIC, didn't like COBAL, Pascall, C nor C++, and couldn't quite get interested in Java but FORTH was interesting and enjoyable)).
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on  anythhing as this is just for the fun of it....
- 📫 However,if someone wishes, the best way to reach me is via e-Mail: zippca@hotmail.com. Which I check infrequently at random times.
